# Info
This is an attempt to fix some minor problems and clarify some things about this specific repo, and hopefully make some pull requests if I ever make any sort of drive to pursue this.
Not many people were exactly knowledgeable on how to compile it, especially since it would return errors since it wouldn't download the dependencies before unless you had an SSH key tied to your Github account.

My main goal is to poke around and make it a bit neater, and potentially provide some insight to FITD itself.
For example, did you know the GOG version of AITD has an ancient version of FITD in the files? Don't believe me? See for yourself.


# The Original Readme

<i>Free in the Dark, a Alone in the Dark engine reimplementation.

Long overdue source code update from the version that was released on source forge in the 2000s.
Only buildable with Visual Studio 2019 for now (cmake via build/vs2019.bat) but other platform should be fairly straight forward.

Rendering is being rewritten to bgfx, for better portability. There is still some graphical artifacts.</i>
